# Combat Hitboxes (But legal on MCC Island)

> [Original mod](https://github.com/sootysplash/combat-hitboxes) made by Sootysplash

## Why?
Original mod breaks the rules of MCC Island. As of making this, there's no better alternative to changing the hitboxes of the player. I decided to fork the original mod and make it follow the rules of MCC Island, so I can easily share it with my friends and other ppl.
